# Mini Message Board Demo

An Express.js app that uses sample filler data to present a message board and the ability to add new messages to it.

Inspired by the [Mini Message Board assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-mini-message-board) as part of the curriculum for the [NodeJS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
